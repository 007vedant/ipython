IPython 6 feature a major improvement in the completion machinery which is now
capable of completing non-executed code. It is also the first version of IPython
to stop compatibility with Python 2, which is still supported on the bugfix only
5.x branch. Read below to have a non-exhaustive list of new features.

Make sure you have pip > 9.0 before upgrading. 
You should be able to update by using:

.. code::

    pip install ipython --upgrade


Autowait: Asynchronous REPL
===========================

Staring with IPython 7.0 and on Python 3.6+, IPython can automatically await
code at top level, you should not need to access an event loop or runner
yourself. To know more read the `autoawait`_ section of our docs, or try the
following code::

   In [6]: from asyncio import sleep
      ...: print('Going to sleep...')
      ...: await sleep(3)
      ...: print('Waking up')
   Going to sleep...
   Waking up

Asynchronous code in a Notebook interface or any other frontend using the
Jupyter Protocol will need further updates of the IPykernel package.


Change to Nested Embed
======================

The introduction of the ability to run async code had ripple effect on the
ability to use nested IPython. You may need to install the ``trio`` library
(version 05 at the time of this writing) to
have this feature working.
