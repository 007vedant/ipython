IPython 6.2 contains all the bugs fixes and features available in IPython 5.5:

 - Built in progress bar support
 - System Wide config

As well as the following:


Function signature
------------------

Terminal IPython will now show the signature of the function while completing.
Only the currently highlighted function will show its signature on the line
below the completer by default. The functionality is recent so might be
limited, we welcome bug report and enhancement request on it. :gh:`10507`

Assignments return values
-------------------------

IPython can now trigger the display hook on last assignment of cells. 
Up until 6.0 the following code wouldn't show the value of the assigned
variable::

    In[1]: xyz = "something"
    # nothing shown

You would have to actually make it the last statement::

    In [2]: xyz = "something else"
    ...   : xyz
    Out[2]: "something else"

With the option ``InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity='last_expr_or_assign'``
you can now do::

    In [2]: xyz = "something else"
    Out[2]: "something else"

This option can be toggled at runtime with the ``%config`` magic, and will
trigger on assignment ``a = 1``, augmented assignment ``+=``, ``-=``, ``|=`` ...
as well as type annotated assignments: ``a:int = 2``.
