Developer's guide for core IPython
==================================

This guide documents the development of core *IPython itself*. Developers of
third party tools and libraries that use IPython should see the 
:doc:`development/index` at `Developer's guide for Third Party Tools and Libraries`.

Developers working on IPython itself should also consult the
`developer information <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Dev:-Index>`_ 
on the IPython GitHub wiki.
