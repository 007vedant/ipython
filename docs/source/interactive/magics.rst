=======================
Built-in magic commands
=======================

.. note::

    To Jupyter users: Magics are specifit to the IPython kernel. Other kernels
    may be implementing magics but this decision is a per-kernel one. To be able
    to work, Magics need to use a syntax which is not valid in the language they
    are implemented. IPython choosed the `%` as it is not a valid unary operator
    in Python. It is in other languages. 


Here is the help auto generated from the docstrings of all the available magics
function that IPython ships with. 

You can create an register your own magics with IPython. You can find many user
defined magics on `PyPI <https://pypi.io>`_. Feel free to publish your own and
use the ``Framework :: IPython`` trove classifier.
